    title: 'Constraining the PG 1553+113 binary hypothesis: interpreting a new, 22-year period',
    description: 'PG 1553+113 is a well-known blazar exhibiting evidence of a ∼2.2-year quasi-periodic oscillation in radio, optical, X-ray, and γ-ray bands. We present evidence of a new, longer oscillation of 21.8±4.7 years in its historical optical light curve covering 100 years of observation. On its own, this ∼22-year period has a statistical significance of 1.9σ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect. However, the probability of both the 2.2- and 22-year periods arising from noise is ∼0.02% (3.5σ). The next peak of the 22-year oscillation should occur around July 2025. We find that the ∼10:1 relation between these two periods can arise in a plausible supermassive black hole binary model. Our interpretation of PG 1553+113\'s two periods suggests that the binary engine has a mass ratio ≳0.2, an eccentricity ≲0.1, and accretes from a disk with characteristic aspect ratio ∼0.03. The putative supermassive black hole binary radiates nHz gravitational waves, but the amplitude is ∼10−100 times too low for detection by foreseeable pulsar timing arrays.',
