      "Enhancing Periodicity Analysis Accuracy Through Phase Fold Amplitude Minimization (PFAM) Technique",
    description:
      "In time-series astronomy, periodicity study is one of the most useful tools to understand an astrophysical system. Research papers on periodicity study often show phase-folded plots to emphasize the presence of periodicity. Depending on the quality of the data points, we can use the phase-folded light curves (LCs) to further enhance the accuracy of the observed period. I discuss an amplitude minimization of the phase-folded LC, which can enhance the accuracy of observed periods in astrophysical LCs.",
